# Contributing

Thanks for taking a look! This repository is a **documentation / showcase** repo for a demo & portfolio artifact.

## Ways to contribute
- Architecture review notes
- Test scenarios (interesting failure patterns)
- Wording improvements (clarity + non-commercial tone)
- Diagrams / UX suggestions

## Ground rules
- No proprietary or production code
- Keep claims realistic (demo-only)
- Prefer verifiable statements over marketing language
